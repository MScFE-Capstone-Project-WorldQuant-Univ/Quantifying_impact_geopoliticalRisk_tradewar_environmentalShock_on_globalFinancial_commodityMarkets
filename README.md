# Quantifying_impact_geopoliticalRisk_tradewar_environmentalShock_on_globalFinancial_commodityMarkets

In this project, we investigate how geopolitical risks, trade wars, and environmental shocks affect the volatility and spillover dynamics existing between global financial markets (S&Pâ€¯500 Index) and commodity markets (WTI crude oil prices).

Our objective is to capture regime-dependent behavior (calm vs. crisis periods) using advanced econometric models:
We use the Markov-Switching GARCH (MS-GARCH) for volatility and regime detection.

Then, the Dynamic Conditional Correlation GARCH (DCC-GARCH) is used to measure time-varying correlations.

Finally, the Diebold-Yilmaz Spillover Index is used for measuring risk transmissions between markets, ie the spillover dynamics.
